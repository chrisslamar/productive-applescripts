# Productive AppleScript

### Why they are useful

Some of these are basic and could be done without the use of the script.  The way that I've utilized them best is to compile the scripts using `Script Editor` then save them to your `~/bin/` folder.  The real usefulness is when you use Spotlight, or Alfred if that's more your liking, to launch them while only having to type a letter or two.  Enjoy!
